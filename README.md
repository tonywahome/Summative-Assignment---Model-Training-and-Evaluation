Multi Classifier Models to distinguish stellar objects in the universe using photometric data

This project details the application of machine learning techniques for classifying astronomical objects, specifically **Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars**, using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). 
This research addresses the challenge of analysing the vast volume of modern astronomical data by **systematically evaluating** various classification algorithms, including **traditional ensemble methods** like XGBoost and Random Forest, as well as **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**. 
The methodology heavily relies on **domain-informed feature engineering**, particularly the use of redshift and engineered color indices, to maximize the predictive accuracy of the models, ultimately finding that XGBoost achieved the **highest performance** with an accuracy of over 99%. 
The project concludes that machine learning provides a **highly accurate and reliable** method for automating celestial object classification, which is crucial for cosmological mapping.
